Gilbert syndrome typically doesn't require treatment or pose serious complications. In fact, Gilbert syndrome is usually not considered a disease because of its benign nature. Many individuals find out they have the disorder by accident, when they have a blood test that shows elevated bilirubin levels. More males than females have been diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome. This condition is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.", "predict": "Gilbert syndrome is a condition that affects the metabolism of bilirubin, a yellowish substance produced during the breakdown of red blood cells. In people with Gilbert syndrome, the liver does not efficiently break down bilirubin, leading to higher than normal levels in the blood. This condition is also known as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nSymptoms of Gilbert syndrome may include yellowing of the skin and eyes, known as jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort. While most individuals with Gilbert syndrome do not experience any significant health issues, some may have mild anemia, which is characterized by a lower than normal number of red blood cells. In rare cases, severe anemia can develop in individuals with Gilbert syndrome.\n\nIt is important to note that Gilbert syndrome is a mild condition and does not typically require medical treatment. However, if symptoms are severe or persist, consultation with a healthcare professional is advised."}

Some families with this condition have been found to have mutations in the PRKAR1A gene. Carney complex is believed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.", "predict": "Carney complex is a rare inherited condition characterized by multiple endocrine tumors. These tumors can affect the pituitary gland, parathyroid glands, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and pancreas. Endocrine tumors are also known as carcinoid tumors, as they are more common in women and tend to develop in the pancreas. Additionally, Carney complex is associated with a predisposition to develop melanocytic nevi, which are benign pigmented growths of the skin.\n\nThe symptoms of Carney complex vary depending on which endocrine tumors are present. Some individuals may have no symptoms at all, while others may experience symptoms such as headaches, weight loss, excessive sweating, weakness, and difficulty breathing. If left untreated, the tumors can grow large and cause complications such as vision loss, kidney failure, or death.\n\nDiagnosis of Carney complex typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging tests, and blood tests to evaluate the presence of endocrine tumors.

The disease primarily affects male infants. Copper accumulates at abnormally low levels in the liver and brain, but at higher than normal levels in the kidney and intestinal lining. Affected infants may be born prematurely, but appear healthy at birth and develop normally for 6 to 8 weeks. Then symptoms begin, including floppy muscle tone, seizures, and failure to thrive. Menkes disease is also characterized by subnormal body temperature and strikingly peculiar hair, which is kinky, colorless or steel-colored, and breaks easily. There is often extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain. Arteries in the brain may be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures.", "predict": "Menkes Disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb copper, a vital mineral essential for normal brain and nerve function. Copper plays a crucial role in the production of collagen, a protein that helps support the structure of tissues in the body. Without sufficient copper, the body cannot produce the necessary collagen, leading to various health complications.\n\nMenkes Disease primarily affects males, with symptoms typically appearing within the first year of life.

The signs and symptoms of this condition typically appear after age 35. The first sign is usually weakness and wasting (atrophy) of a muscle in the lower leg called the tibialis anterior. This muscle helps control up-and-down movement of the foot. Weakness in the tibialis anterior muscle makes it difficult or impossible to walk on the heels, but it usually does not interfere significantly with regular walking.  Muscle weakness worsens very slowly in people with tibial muscular dystrophy. Ten to 20 years after the onset of symptoms, weakness may develop in muscles that help extend the toes (long-toe extensors). Weakness in these muscles makes it difficult to lift the toes while walking, a condition known as foot drop. Later in life, about one third of people with tibial muscular dystrophy experience mild to moderate difficulty with walking because of weakness in other leg muscles. However, most affected individuals remain able to walk throughout their lives.  A small percentage of people with tibial muscular dystrophy have a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms than those described above. Starting in childhood, these individuals may have generalized muscle weakness, weakness and atrophy of the thigh muscles (quadriceps) or other muscles in the legs, and weakness affecting muscles in the arms.", "predict": "Tibial muscular dystrophy is a rare genetic condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, which primarily affects the calf muscles. Individuals with tibial muscular dystrophy typically develop muscle weakness in their calves starting at an early age, with the condition worsening over time. This weakness can make it difficult for affected individuals to walk or run, leading to gait abnormalities and difficulties with balance. In addition, individuals with tibial muscular dystrophy may experience weakness in their shoulders, neck, and upper arms. The exact cause of tibial muscular dystrophy is unknown, but it is thought to be due to mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a protein involved in maintaining muscle health.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is (are) type 1 diabetes?\n\n### Response:\n", "label": "Type 1 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels. In this form of diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells stop producing insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Lack of insulin results in the inability to use glucose for energy or to control the amount of sugar in the blood.  Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age; however, it usually develops by early adulthood, most often starting in adolescence. The first signs and symptoms of the disorder are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet, and weight loss. These symptoms may recur during the course of the disorder if blood sugar is not well controlled by insulin replacement therapy. Improper control can also cause blood sugar levels to become too low (hypoglycemia). This may occur when the body's needs change, such as during exercise or if eating is delayed. Hypoglycemia can cause headache, dizziness, hunger, shaking, sweating, weakness, and agitation.  Uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lead to a life-threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis. Without insulin, cells cannot take in glucose. A lack of glucose in cells prompts the liver to try to compensate by releasing more glucose into the blood, and blood sugar can become extremely high. The cells, unable to use the glucose in the blood for energy, respond by using fats instead. Breaking down fats to obtain energy produces waste products called ketones, which can build up to toxic levels in people with type 1 diabetes, resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Affected individuals may begin breathing rapidly; develop a fruity odor in the breath; and experience nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, stomach pain, and dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). In severe cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death.  Over many years, the chronic high blood sugar associated with diabetes may cause damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications affecting many organs and tissues. The retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, can be damaged (diabetic retinopathy), leading to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) may also occur and can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pain, tingling, and loss of normal sensation (diabetic neuropathy) often occur, especially in the feet. Impaired circulation and absence of the normal sensations that prompt reaction to injury can result in permanent damage to the feet; in severe cases, the damage can lead to amputation. People with type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and problems with urinary and sexual function.", "predict": "Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is a chronic condition where the body stops producing insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin is needed to convert sugar, starches, and other food into energy needed for daily activities. Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and can damage many parts of the body, including the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. This results in the body's inability to regulate blood sugar levels. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, weight loss, blurry vision, fatigue, and slow healing of cuts or bruises. Treatment for type 1 diabetes includes insulin injections to replace the missing insulin and lifestyle changes to manage blood sugar levels."}

Several individual bones make up each wrist (carpal bones) and ankle (tarsal bones). In tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, the carpal bones fuse together, as do the tarsal bones, which causes stiffness and immobility of the hands and feet. Symptoms of the condition can become apparent in infancy, and they worsen with age. The severity of the symptoms can vary, even among members of the same family.  In this condition, fusion at the joints between the bones that make up each finger and toe (symphalangism) can also occur. Consequently, the fingers and toes become stiff and difficult to bend. Stiffness of the pinky fingers and toes (fifth digits) is usually noticeable first. The joints at the base of the pinky fingers and toes fuse first, and slowly, the other joints along the length of these digits may also be affected. Progressively, the bones in the fourth, third, and second digits (the ring finger, middle finger, and forefinger, and the corresponding toes) become fused. The thumb and big toe are usually not involved. Affected individuals have increasing trouble forming a fist, and walking often becomes painful and difficult. Occasionally, there is also fusion of bones in the upper and lower arm at the elbow joint (humeroradial fusion). Less common features of tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome include short stature or the development of hearing loss.", "predict": "Tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome is a rare condition that involves the fusion of bones in the foot.

Except in the most severe cases, the lifespan of people with craniometaphyseal dysplasia is normal.  Bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent (non-erupting) teeth. Infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness.  The x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. The ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition.

This condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). As the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. Usually only one eye is affected. Some people with Duane syndrome develop amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye. Most cases occur without other signs and symptoms. There are three forms of Duane syndrome, designated types 1, 2, and 3. The types vary in which eye movements are most severely restricted (inward, outward, or both). All three types are characterized by retraction of the eyeball as the eye moves inward and are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.", "predict": "Duane syndrome type 2 is a genetic disorder characterized by an inability to move the eye from side to side. This condition is caused by a mutation in the _COL5A1_ gene, which is responsible for producing collagen, a protein essential for the structure and function of many tissues in the body. Duane syndrome type 2 typically affects one eye more than the other, with the affected eye unable to move fully in both the up and down directions. Individuals with Duane syndrome type 2 may also experience nystagmus, an involuntary eye movement disorder, and limited movement of the jaw and tongue.\n\nThe symptoms of Duane syndrome type 2 vary depending on the specific gene mutation causing the condition. In some cases, individuals may only have mild symptoms, while others may experience more severe forms of the disorder. Treatment for Duane syndrome type 2 typically involves physical therapy and surgery to improve eye movement and alignment.

The disease affects both men and women. Before age 45, osteoarthritis is more common in men than in women. After age 45, osteoarthritis is more common in women. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints, breaks down and wears away. In some cases, all of the cartilage may wear away, leaving bones that rub up against each other. Joint Stiffness and Pain Symptoms range from stiffness and mild pain that comes and goes to severe joint pain. Osteoarthritis affects hands, low back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. osteoarthritis affects just joints, not internal organs. Hands Osteoarthritis of the hands seems to run in families. If your mother or grandmother has or had osteoarthritis in their hands, youre at greater-than-average risk of having it too. Women are more likely than men to have osteoarthritis in the hands. For most women, it develops after menopause. When osteoarthritis involves the hands, small, bony knobs may appear on the end joints (those closest to the nails) of the fingers. They are called Heberdens (HEBerr-denz) nodes. Similar knobs, called Bouchards (boo-SHARDZ) nodes, can appear on the middle joints of the fingers. Fingers can become enlarged and gnarled, and they may ache or be stiff and numb. The base of the thumb joint also is commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Knees The knees are among the joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include stiffness, swelling, and pain, which make it hard to walk, climb, and get in and out of chairs and bathtubs. Osteoarthritis in the knees can lead to disability. Hips The hips are also common sites of osteoarthritis. As with knee osteoarthritis, symptoms of hip osteoarthritis include pain and stiffness of the joint itself. But sometimes pain is felt in the groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or even the knees. Osteoarthritis of the hip may limit moving and bending, making daily activities such as dressing and putting on shoes a challenge. Spine Osteoarthritis of the spine may show up as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. In some cases, arthritis-related changes in the spine can cause pressure on the nerves where they exit the spinal column, resulting in weakness, tingling, or numbness of the arms and legs. In severe cases, this can even affect bladder and bowel function.", "predict": "Osteoarthritis, commonly known as degenerative joint disease, is a chronic condition that affects the joints in the body. It is a leading cause of disability in the United States, with over 30 million Americans currently living with the condition.

They are delayed in learning to walk and developing fine motor skills such as picking up small items with their fingers. People with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome typically do not develop speech; some may learn to say a few words. Many affected individuals exhibit features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills.  Breathing problems in individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome are characterized by episodes of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) followed by periods in which breathing slows or stops (apnea). These episodes can cause a lack of oxygen in the blood, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). In some cases, the lack of oxygen can cause loss of consciousness. Some older individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome develop widened and rounded tips of the fingers and toes (clubbing) because of recurrent episodes of decreased oxygen in the blood. The breathing problems occur only when the person is awake and typically first appear in mid-childhood, but they can begin as early as infancy. Episodes of hyperventilation and apnea can be triggered by emotions such as excitement or anxiety or by extreme tiredness (fatigue).  Epilepsy occurs in most people with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and usually begins during childhood, although it can be present from birth.  Individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome have distinctive facial features that include thin eyebrows, sunken eyes, a prominent nose with a high nasal bridge, a pronounced double curve of the upper lip (Cupid's bow), a wide mouth with full lips, and widely spaced teeth.

Each episode of fever lasts about 3 to 6 days, and the frequency of the episodes varies among affected individuals. In childhood the fevers seem to be more frequent, occurring as often as 25 times a year, but as the individual gets older the episodes occur less often.  Mevalonate kinase deficiency has additional signs and symptoms, and the severity depends on the type of the condition. There are two types of mevalonate kinase deficiency: a less severe type called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) and a more severe type called mevalonic aciduria (MVA).  During episodes of fever, people with HIDS typically have enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), abdominal pain, joint pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, and headache. Occasionally they will have painful sores called aphthous ulcers around their mouth. In females, these may also occur around the vagina. A small number of people with HIDS have intellectual disability, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), eye problems, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Rarely, people with HIDS develop a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure. Fever episodes in individuals with HIDS can be triggered by vaccinations, surgery, injury, or stress. Most people with HIDS have abnormally high levels of immune system proteins called immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the blood. It is unclear why people with HIDS have high levels of IgD and IgA. Elevated levels of these immunoglobulins do not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. Individuals with HIDS do not have any signs and symptoms of the condition between fever episodes and typically have a normal life expectancy.  People with MVA have signs and symptoms of the condition at all times, not just during episodes of fever. Affected children have developmental delay, progressive ataxia, progressive problems with vision, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Individuals with MVA typically have an unusually small, elongated head. In childhood or adolescence, affected individuals may develop eye problems such as inflammation of the eye (uveitis), a blue tint in the white part of the eye (blue sclera), an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss, or clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). Affected adults may have short stature and may develop muscle weakness (myopathy) later in life. During fever episodes, people with MVA may have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin rashes. Children with MVA who are severely affected with multiple problems may live only into early childhood; mildly affected individuals may have a normal life expectancy.", "predict": "Mevalonate kinase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in the MVK gene. This gene is responsible for producing mevalonate kinase, an enzyme that plays a vital role in the body's metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Individuals with mevalonate kinase deficiency typically have symptoms such as recurrent episodes of fever, rash, and joint pain, which are known as febrile episodes. These episodes can occur anywhere from 2 to 4 times a week, usually at night, and may last for several days. Additionally, individuals with mevalonate kinase deficiency may have episodes of swelling of the face and neck, which is referred to as angioedema.\n\nIt is important to note that mevalonate kinase deficiency is not contagious, and it is not caused by a bacterial or viral infection. However, it is crucial to recognize and treat the febrile episodes associated with this condition to prevent complications. Treatment options for mevalonate kinase deficiency include medications to reduce inflammation and control febrile episodes, as well as monitoring for other complications that may arise due to the underlying genetic disorder."}

It uses high-frequency sound waves to look at organs and structures inside the body. Health care professionals use it to view the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver, and other organs. During pregnancy, doctors use ultrasound to view the fetus. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound does not expose you to radiation.    During an ultrasound test, you lie on a table. A special technician or doctor moves a device called a transducer over part of your body. The transducer sends out sound waves, which bounce off the tissues inside your body. The transducer also captures the waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine creates images from the sound waves.", "predict": "Ultrasound is a medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of the body. It is used to visualize internal structures such as organs, blood vessels, and soft tissues. Ultrasound scans are non-invasive and painless, making them a popular choice for diagnostic imaging. The sound waves used in ultrasound are inaudible to the human ear, but can be detected by a transducer that converts them into electrical signals that are then processed to produce an image.\n\nUltrasound imaging is widely used in many medical specialties, including obstetrics and gynecology, cardiology, urology, vascular surgery, and emergency medicine. It is particularly useful for visualizing fetal development in pregnant women, as well as the anatomy of the urinary tract, blood vessels, and the heart.\n\nIn addition to its diagnostic uses, ultrasound can also be used for therapeutic purposes. Some procedures involving ultrasound, such as lithotripsy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, use high-frequency sound waves to break up kidney stones. Ultrasound-guided interventions are also commonly used in minimally invasive surgical procedures to provide real-time visualization of the surgical field.\n\nOverall, ultrasound plays a crucial role in medical imaging, providing valuable information to healthcare providers for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of various conditions."}

Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland at the base of the brain) fails to produce enough adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce the hormone cortisol. The lack of these hormones in the body can be caused by reduction or cessation of corticosteroid medication, the surgical removal of pituitary tumors, or changes in the pituitary gland. Symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency may include severe fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, irritability, and depression. Treatment includes replacing the hormones that the adrenal glands are not making. The dose of each medication is adjusted to meet the needs of each affected individual.", "predict": "Secondary adrenal insufficiency is a condition characterized by insufficient production of cortisol, a hormone that plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress. This condition can result from a variety of causes, including pituitary gland disorders, infections, or certain medications. It is important to note that primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves the adrenal glands themselves, is distinct from secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\nIn secondary adrenal insufficiency, the pituitary gland produces inadequate levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is essential for the production of cortisol. This hormone is crucial in maintaining normal blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and response to stress. Symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency can include fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, and decreased response to stress.\n\nIf left untreated, secondary adrenal insufficiency can lead to severe complications such as shock, coma, and even death.

Lung cancer may or may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, blood in the mucus, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.  Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.  Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and often spreads to other tissues (metastasizes), most commonly to the adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney), liver, brain, and bones. In more than half of cases, the small cell lung cancer has spread beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about one year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.  Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma describes non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. As the name suggests, the tumor cells are large when viewed under a microscope. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.", "predict": "Lung cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the lungs. It can be classified into two main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Small cell lung cancer is characterized by its rapid growth and spread throughout the body, while non-small cell lung cancer tends to grow more slowly and is typically diagnosed at a later stage.\n\nOne of the primary causes of lung cancer is smoking, which can damage the lungs over time. Exposure to other substances, such as radon gas, asbestos, and air pollution, can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Individuals with a family history of lung cancer may also be at a higher risk.\n\nSymptoms of lung cancer can include persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and unexplained weight loss. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of medical imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, and PET scans, as well as a biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer cells.\n\nTreatment options for lung cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. The type of treatment recommended will depend on the stage of the cancer, individual factors, and the specific characteristics of the tumor."}

People with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome have chronic kidney disease that begins in childhood and gets worse over time. The rate at which the kidney disease worsens is variable, but the condition eventually leads to kidney failure in most affected individuals.  Degeneration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) almost always occurs in this disorder, but the age at which this feature develops varies. Some affected individuals are blind or have severe vision impairment beginning in infancy, with the pattern of vision loss resembling a condition called Leber congenital amaurosis. In other people with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, the retinal degeneration begins in childhood, but some vision is retained into early adulthood. The vision loss in these affected individuals resembles a category of retinal disorders called rod-cone dystrophies. The most common rod-cone dystrophy is called retinitis pigmentosa, and the vision problems in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome are sometimes referred to as such. However, the abnormal deposits of pigment in the retina from which retinitis pigmentosa gets its name are often not found in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome. As a result, some researchers use terms such as \"atypical retinitis pigmentosa without pigment\" to describe the retinal degeneration that occurs in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome.  The skeletal abnormality most characteristic of Mainzer-Saldino syndrome consists of cone-shaped ends of the bones (epiphyses) in the fingers (phalanges) that can be seen on x-ray images after the first year of life. Affected individuals may also have abnormalities of the thigh bones that occur in the epiphyses and adjacent areas where bone growth occurs (the metaphyses). Occasionally, other skeletal abnormalities occur, including short stature and premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) that affects the shape of the head and face. Affected individuals may also have a small rib cage, which sometimes causes breathing problems in infancy, but the breathing problems are usually mild.  A small number of individuals with this disorder have additional problems affecting other organs.

The rapid rise in sodium concentration is accompanied by the movement of small molecules and pulls water from brain cells. Through a mechanism that is only partly understood, the shift in water and brain molecules leads to the destruction of myelin, a substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. Nerve cells (neurons) can also be damaged. Certain areas of the brain are particularly susceptible to myelinolysis, especially the part of the brain stem called the pons. Some individuals will also have damage in other areas of the brain, which is called extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM). Experts estimate that 10 percent of those with CPM will also have areas of EPM.\n                \nThe initial symptoms of myelinolysis, which begin to appear 2 to 3 days after hyponatremia is corrected, include a depressed level of awareness, difficulty speaking (dysarthria or mutism), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Additional symptoms often arise over the next 1-2 weeks, including impaired thinking, weakness or paralysis in the arms and legs, stiffness, impaired sensation, and difficulty with coordination. At its most severe, myelinolysis can lead to coma, locked-in syndrome (which is the complete paralysis of all of the voluntary muscles in the body except for those that control the eyes), and death.\n                \nAlthough many affected people improve over weeks to months, some have permanent disability.

The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In Diamond-Blackfan anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. The resulting shortage of red blood cells (anemia) usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor).  People with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing certain cancers, including a cancer of blood-forming tissue known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma.  Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities. They may have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and a low frontal hairline, along with distinctive facial features such as wide-set eyes (hypertelorism); droopy eyelids (ptosis); a broad, flat bridge of the nose; small, low-set ears; and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Affected individuals may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the upper lip (cleft lip). They may have a short, webbed neck; shoulder blades which are smaller and higher than usual; and abnormalities of their hands, most commonly malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature.  Other features of Diamond-Blackfan anemia may include eye problems such as clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma), or eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Affected individuals may also have kidney abnormalities; structural defects of the heart; and, in males, the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias).  The severity of Diamond-Blackfan anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Diamond-Blackfan anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms that may include mild anemia beginning in adulthood.", "predict": "Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare condition that affects the bone marrow, causing a deficiency in the production of red blood cells. This deficiency can lead to anemia, a condition characterized by a lower than normal number of red blood cells in the body. Red blood cells are responsible for transporting oxygen to all the tissues in the body, including the brain. Without sufficient red blood cells, tissues and organs may not receive enough oxygen, leading to a range of symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of Diamond-Blackfan anemia may vary in severity and onset. Some individuals with this condition may experience mild symptoms, while others may experience more severe symptoms. In addition to anemia, individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia may also experience shortness of breath, pale skin, fatigue, and enlarged spleen. In some cases, individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia may develop heart and kidney problems.\n\nTreatment for Diamond-Blackfan anemia typically involves supportive care to manage symptoms and complications. Treatment options may include blood transfusions, medications to stimulate red blood cell production, and monitoring for potential complications. It is important for individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia to work closely with a healthcare provider to manage their condition effectively and improve their overall health and quality of life."}

People with these conditions can present at any age with almost any affected body system; however, the brain, muscles, heart, liver, nerves, eyes, ears and kidneys are the organs and tissues most commonly affected. Symptom severity can also vary widely. Mitochondrial genetic disorders can be caused by changes (mutations) in either the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that lead to dysfunction of the mitochondria and inadequate production of energy. Those caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA are transmitted by maternal inheritance, while those caused by mutations in nuclear DNA may follow an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern of inheritance. Treatment varies based on the specific type of condition and the signs and symptoms present in each person.", "predict": "Mitochondrial genetic disorders are a group of conditions that affect the mitochondria, the energy-producing powerhouses of cells. These disorders can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, muscle cramps, muscle stiffness, muscle twitching, muscle wasting, difficulty swallowing, seizures, speech problems, blindness, deafness, heart problems, and intellectual disability. In some cases, symptoms may be mild, while in others, they may be severe and life-threatening.\n\nThere are many different types of mitochondrial genetic disorders, each with its own unique characteristics. Some common mitochondrial genetic disorders include Leigh syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers), and NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa). These disorders can be inherited in various ways, such as from a mother to a child, from a father to a child, or through a combination of both maternal and paternal inheritance.\n\nTreatment for mitochondrial genetic disorders often focuses on managing symptoms and addressing specific complications. In some cases, treatment may involve a combination of medications, therapies, and supportive care. It is important for individuals with mitochondrial genetic disorders to work closely with healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that meets their specific needs."}

AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Cancers that are acute usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Cancers that are chronic usually get worse slowly.\n                \n                \n                    Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.    A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.         In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). The myeloblasts, or leukemia cells, in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. Sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma.   There are subtypes of AML based on the type of blood cell that is affected. The treatment of AML is different when it is a subtype called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or when the child has Down syndrome.\n                \n                \n                    Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow.\n                    Chronic myelogenous leukemia    In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), too many bone marrow stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes. Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These are called blasts. Over time, the granulocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. CML is rare in children.        Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia     Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare childhood cancer that occurs more often in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys. In JMML, too many bone marrow stem cells become 2 types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature cells, called blasts, are unable to do their usual work. Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.       Myelodysplastic syndromes     Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) occur less often in children than in adults. In MDS, the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These blood cells may not mature and enter the blood. The treatment for MDS depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are. Over time, MDS may become AML.    Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) is a type of MDS. This disorder of the bone marrow can develop in newborns who have Down syndrome. It usually goes away on its own within the first 3 weeks of life. Infants who have Down syndrome and TMD have an increased chance of developing AML before the age of 3 years.

The risk of these therapy-related myeloid diseases depends on the total dose of the anticancer drugs used and the radiation dose and treatment field. Some patients also have an inherited risk for t-AML and t-MDS. These therapy-related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment, but are rare in children.", "predict": "Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies are rare types of blood cancers that primarily affect children and young adults. These conditions involve the myeloid cells of the bone marrow, which produce blood cells like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Dicarboxylic amino acids are a group of amino acids that contain two carboxylic acid groups, and their presence in the body is indicative of a problem with the amino acid metabolism. The most common cause of dicarboxylic aminoaciduria is glutaric aciduria type I, which is a disorder of the metabolism of the amino acid glutamate. Individuals with glutaric aciduria type I have an inability to convert glutamate into another amino acid called alpha-ketoglutarate. This leads to the accumulation of glutaric acid and its derivatives in the body, which can cause serious complications.\n\nIn addition to glutaric aciduria type I, other conditions that can lead to dicarboxylic aminoaciduria include:\n\n1. Isodecarboxylase deficiency: This is a rare disorder that results from a defect in the enzyme isodecarboxylase, which is necessary for the breakdown of dicarboxylic amino acids. Individuals with isodecarboxylase deficiency have an inability to break down dicarboxylic amino acids, leading to their accumulation in the body.\n\n2. Isovaleric acidemia: Isovaleric acidemia is a disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of isovaleric acid. Individuals with isovaleric acidemia have an inability to break down isovaleric acid, leading to its accumulation in the body.\n\n3. Multiple carboxylase deficiency: This condition is caused by a defect in the enzyme multiple carboxylase, which is responsible for the conversion of dicarboxylic amino acids into other amino acids. Individuals with multiple carboxylase deficiency have an inability to break down dicarboxylic amino acids, leading to their accumulation in the body.\n\nOverall, dicarboxylic aminoaciduria is a group of disorders characterized by the accumulation of dicarboxylic amino acids in the body. The specific type of dicarboxylic aminoaciduria depends on the underlying cause, which can range from defects in specific enzymes to disorders of amino acid metabolism."}

Enlargement of the jaw usually continues throughout childhood and stabilizes during puberty. The abnormal growths are gradually replaced with normal bone in early adulthood. As a result, many affected adults have a normal facial appearance.  Most people with cherubism have few, if any, signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body. Rarely, however, this condition occurs as part of another genetic disorder. For example, cherubism can occur with Ramon syndrome, which also involves short stature, intellectual disability, and overgrowth of the gums (gingival fibrosis). Additionally, cherubism has been reported in rare cases of Noonan syndrome (a developmental disorder characterized by unusual facial characteristics, short stature, and heart defects) and fragile X syndrome (a condition primarily affecting males that causes learning disabilities and cognitive impairment).", "predict": "Cherubism is a rare inherited disorder characterized by benign tumors in the jawbone. These tumors are often present at birth but may not be noticeable until early childhood. The tumors can range in size from a pea to a marble and are typically painless. Over time, the tumors can cause the jawbone to weaken, leading to facial asymmetry and tooth loss. Treatment for cherubism may include surgical removal of the tumors or other procedures to correct facial asymmetry. In some cases, the tumors may not require treatment, as they can spontaneously regress or stabilize. It is important to note that cherubism is a benign condition, with a favorable prognosis."}

In its early stages, it is usually painless, and many people are not aware that they have it. But in more advanced stages, gum disease can lead to sore or bleeding gums, painful chewing problems, and even tooth loss.", "predict": "Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is a common condition that affects the gums and surrounding tissues of the teeth. Gum disease can occur at any age, but it is more prevalent in adults over the age of 30. The main types of gum disease are gingivitis and periodontitis. \n\nGingivitis is the early stage of gum disease, where the gums become inflamed and bleed easily. It is typically reversible with proper oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups. Periodontitis is the advanced stage of gum disease, where the gums separate from the teeth, leading to bone loss and tooth loss if left untreated.\n\nThe symptoms of gum disease can include swollen, red, or bleeding gums, bad breath, loose teeth, or changes in the fit of partial dentures. It is important to seek professional dental care if you experience any signs of gum disease to prevent further damage to the teeth and gums.\n\nIn conclusion, gum disease is a common condition that can affect individuals of all ages.

A lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the function of muscle cells.  People with GSDV typically experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during the first few minutes of exercise (exercise intolerance). Exercise such as weight lifting or jogging usually triggers these symptoms in affected individuals. The discomfort is generally alleviated with rest. If individuals rest after brief exercise and wait for their pain to go away, they can usually resume exercising with little or no discomfort (a characteristic phenomenon known as \"second wind\").  Prolonged or intense exercise can cause muscle damage in people with GSDV. About half of people with GSDV experience breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). In severe episodes, the destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is filtered through the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown. This protein can also damage the kidneys, and it is estimated that half of those individuals with GSDV who have myoglobinuria will develop life-threatening kidney failure.  The signs and symptoms of GSDV can vary significantly in affected individuals. The features of this condition typically begin in a person's teens or twenties, but they can appear anytime from infancy to adulthood. In most people with GSDV, the muscle weakness worsens over time; however, in about one-third of affected individuals, the muscle weakness is stable. Some people with GSDV experience mild symptoms such as poor stamina; others do not experience any symptoms.", "predict": "Glycogen storage disease type V is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of glycogen, a type of sugar stored in the liver and muscles. This condition is caused by a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme, which is responsible for converting glycogen into smaller units that can be broken down and used as energy.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of glycogen storage disease type V vary depending on the severity of the disorder. Some affected individuals may have mild symptoms, such as liver disease or muscle weakness, while others may experience more severe symptoms that can lead to death in early childhood. Common signs and symptoms of glycogen storage disease type V include:\n\n1. Liver disease: Liver disease is a common complication of glycogen storage disease type V. The liver may become enlarged (hepatomegaly) and can become inflamed (hepatitis). Liver disease can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and fatigue.\n\n2. Muscle weakness: Muscle weakness is another common sign of glycogen storage disease type V. Muscle weakness can affect the legs, arms, and other parts of the body and can lead to difficulty walking and other mobility issues.\n\n3. Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia is a condition in which blood sugar levels are too low. Affected individuals with glycogen storage disease type V may experience episodes of hypoglycemia, which can cause symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, and confusion.\n\n4. Cardiomyopathy: Some individuals with glycogen storage disease type V may develop a condition called cardiomyopathy, which affects the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure.\n\n5. Diabetes: A few individuals with glycogen storage disease type V may develop diabetes, a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nOverall, glycogen storage disease type V is a complex condition that can have a wide range of signs and symptoms, some of which may be mild and others more severe. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for managing this condition and improving the quality of life for affected individuals."}

The condition is so named because L-xylulose is a type of sugar called a pentose. Despite the excess sugar, affected individuals have no associated health problems.", "predict": "Pentosuria is a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down pentoses, a type of sugar. Pentoses are found in fruits, vegetables, and grains, but people with pentosuria cannot break down these sugars efficiently. As a result, pentoses accumulate in the body and are excreted in the urine.\n\nSymptoms of pentosuria include the production of a foul-smelling urine, which may be visible in the urine. This foul-smelling urine is due to the breakdown of pentoses by bacteria in the urinary tract, resulting in the production of sulfur compounds. These sulfur compounds give the urine a foul odor and may cause skin irritation.\n\nIn addition to the foul-smelling urine, pentosuria can also lead to a buildup of pentoses in the blood and other body tissues, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Some people with pentosuria may also experience episodes of severe abdominal pain, which can be associated with dehydration.\n\nTreatment for pentosuria typically involves monitoring the urine for the presence of pentoses and adjusting the diet accordingly. It is important for people with pentosuria to avoid foods high in pentoses, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains, to prevent further accumulation of these sugars in the body.

People with this disorder have a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Specifically, pyruvate kinase deficiency is a common cause of a type of inherited hemolytic anemia called hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. In hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the red blood cells do not assume a spherical shape as they do in some other forms of hemolytic anemia.  Chronic hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an excess of iron in the blood, and small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or bile ducts (gallstones) are also common in this disorder.  In people with pyruvate kinase deficiency, hemolytic anemia and associated complications may range from mild to severe. Some affected individuals have few or no symptoms. Severe cases can be life-threatening in infancy, and such affected individuals may require regular blood transfusions to survive.

Thyroxine-binding globulin is a protein that carries hormones made or used by the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Most of the time, these hormones circulate in the bloodstream attached to thyroxine-binding globulin and similar proteins. If there is a shortage (deficiency) of thyroxine-binding globulin, the amount of circulating thyroid hormones is reduced.  Researchers have identified two forms of inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency: the complete form (TBG-CD), which results in a total loss of thyroxine-binding globulin, and the partial form (TBG-PD), which reduces the amount of this protein or alters its structure. Neither of these conditions causes any problems with thyroid function. They are usually identified during routine blood tests that measure thyroid hormones.  Although inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency does not cause any health problems, it can be mistaken for more serious thyroid disorders (such as hypothyroidism). Therefore, it is important to diagnose inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency to avoid unnecessary treatments.", "predict": "Inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency is a rare condition that affects the thyroid hormone-binding protein thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). This condition results in lower than normal levels of TBG, leading to reduced binding of thyroid hormones to TBG. The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are then unable to exert their normal functions in the body. As a result, symptoms of hypothyroidism may develop in affected individuals.\n\nThe symptoms of hypothyroidism associated with inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the condition. These symptoms may include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, muscle cramps, hair loss, and dry hair. Some individuals may also experience menstrual irregularities, cold hands and feet, and a slower heart rate.\n\nIt is important to note that inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency is a rare condition, and it is estimated that only 10-15 individuals in the United States are affected by this condition. Additionally, the condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must carry the defective gene for the condition to be passed on to their offspring."}

People with this disorder often have an unusually small head at birth, and the head does not grow at the same rate as the rest of the body, so it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body grows (progressive microcephaly). Affected individuals have developmental delay and intellectual disability that can range from mild to severe. Speech and language problems are also common in this disorder.  Facial abnormalities that occur in MFDM include underdevelopment of the middle of the face and the cheekbones (midface and malar hypoplasia) and an unusually small lower jaw (mandibular hypoplasia, also called micrognathia). The external ears are small and abnormally shaped, and they may have skin growths in front of them called preauricular tags. There may also be abnormalities of the ear canal, the tiny bones in the ears (ossicles), or a part of the inner ear called the semicircular canals. These ear abnormalities lead to hearing loss in most affected individuals. Some people with MFDM have an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), which may also contribute to hearing loss by increasing the risk of ear infections. Affected individuals can also have a blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia) that can cause respiratory problems.  Heart problems, abnormalities of the thumbs, and short stature are other features that can occur in MFDM. Some people with this disorder also have blockage of the esophagus (esophageal atresia). In esophageal atresia, the upper esophagus does not connect to the lower esophagus and stomach. Most babies born with esophageal atresia (EA) also have a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), in which the esophagus and the trachea are abnormally connected, allowing fluids from the esophagus to get into the airways and interfere with breathing.

These symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the underlying cause. Encephalopathy can manifest in several forms, including hepatic encephalopathy, metabolic encephalopathy, infectious encephalopathy, drug-induced encephalopathy, and hereditary encephalopathy. Each form of encephalopathy has its own unique set of symptoms and requires specific treatment strategies to manage the condition effectively.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy is a common type of encephalopathy that occurs when the liver is unable to properly remove toxins from the blood. This can lead to the buildup of toxins in the brain, causing symptoms such as confusion, agitation, impaired consciousness, and even coma. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy typically involves addressing the underlying liver disease, along with supportive measures to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.\n\nMetabolic encephalopathy is another type of encephalopathy that can result from a wide range of metabolic disorders. These disorders can interfere with the body's ability to properly metabolize nutrients and remove toxins, leading to brain dysfunction and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and seizures. Management of metabolic encephalopathy often involves addressing the underlying metabolic disorder and providing supportive care to manage symptoms and improve overall brain function.\n\nInfectious encephalopathy is a type of encephalopathy caused by an infection, usually a virus or bacteria. This condition can lead to a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, confusion, seizures, and coma. Treatment for infectious encephalopathy typically involves addressing the underlying infection, along with supportive measures to manage symptoms and promote recovery.\n\nDrug-induced encephalopathy can occur when a drug interacts with the brain in a harmful way. This can result in symptoms such as confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and seizures. Management of drug-induced encephalopathy involves addressing the underlying drug and providing supportive care to manage symptoms and promote recovery.\n\nHereditary encephalopathies are rare conditions that are inherited and can lead to brain dysfunction. These conditions can present with a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, seizures, cognitive impairment, and movement disorders. Management of hereditary encephalopathies involves early diagnosis and supportive care to help individuals with these conditions lead as normal a life as possible.\n\nIn conclusion, encephalopathy refers to a group of symptoms that can result from various conditions affecting the brain. Each type of encephalopathy has its own unique set of symptoms and requires specific treatment strategies to manage the condition effectively. By understanding the different forms of encephalopathy, healthcare providers can provide appropriate care and support to individuals with these conditions."}

The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin.   There are two general types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)     Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age.

This condition affects blood flow in small blood vessels, particularly cerebral vessels within the brain. The muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels (vascular smooth muscle cells) are abnormal and gradually die. In the brain, the resulting blood vessel damage (arteriopathy) can cause migraines, often with visual sensations or auras, or recurrent seizures (epilepsy).  Damaged blood vessels reduce blood flow and can cause areas of tissue death (infarcts) throughout the body. An infarct in the brain can lead to a stroke. In individuals with CADASIL, a stroke can occur at any time from childhood to late adulthood, but typically happens during mid-adulthood. People with CADASIL often have more than one stroke in their lifetime. Recurrent strokes can damage the brain over time. Strokes that occur in the subcortical region of the brain, which is involved in reasoning and memory, can cause progressive loss of intellectual function (dementia) and changes in mood and personality.  Many people with CADASIL also develop leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The age at which the signs and symptoms of CADASIL first begin varies greatly among affected individuals, as does the severity of these features.  CADASIL is not associated with the common risk factors for stroke and heart attack, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, although some affected individuals might also have these health problems.", "predict": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a genetic condition that primarily affects the brain. Individuals with CADASIL typically develop symptoms such as migraines, stroke, seizures, dementia, and psychiatric issues. The condition is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which is responsible for regulating blood vessel formation and function.\n\nIn CADASIL, there is a buildup of a protein called Notch3 in blood vessels. This buildup causes the blood vessels to become narrow and fragile, leading to decreased blood flow to the brain. The decreased blood flow can result in strokes, which can further contribute to the symptoms of CADASIL. Additionally, the blood vessel changes in CADASIL can lead to cognitive impairment, mood changes, and memory loss.\n\nCADASIL is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that individuals with the condition have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals in the general population carry the NOTCH3 mutation associated with CADASIL."}

A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.    A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.         In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. Sometimes in AML, too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets. These abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts. Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums.   This summary is about adult AML.

Spinocerebellar ataxia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 gene (ATXN3).", "predict": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 3, often referred to as SCA3, is a neurological disorder that affects movement and coordination. SCA3 is a progressive condition that typically manifests in childhood or adolescence. Individuals with SCA3 may experience a variety of symptoms, including uncoordinated movements, difficulty walking, and impaired balance. These symptoms are often accompanied by other neurological signs, such as cognitive impairment, dementia, and ataxia. SCA3 is caused by a mutation in the ATXN3 gene, which is responsible for producing the ataxin-3 protein. This protein is involved in the normal functioning of the nervous system, but in individuals with SCA3, it forms abnormal structures that disrupt the balance between cell growth and cell death. The accumulation of these abnormal structures leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of SCA3."}

But people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are extremely worried about these and many other things, even when there is little or no reason to worry about them. They are very anxious about just getting through the day. They think things will always go badly. At times, worrying keeps people with GAD from doing everyday tasks. People with GAD cant seem to get rid of their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. They cant relax, startle easily, and have difficulty concentrating. Often they have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Physical symptoms that often accompany the anxiety include fatigue, headaches, muscle tension, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, trembling, twitching, irritability, sweating, nausea, lightheadedness, having to go to the bathroom frequently, feeling out of breath, and hot flashes. When their anxiety level is mild, people with GAD can function socially and hold down a job. Although they dont avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder, people with GAD can have difficulty carrying out the simplest daily activities if their anxiety is severe.  Learn more about generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).", "predict": "Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions that are characterized by feelings of excessive worry, fear, or anxiety. Individuals with anxiety disorders often experience a range of symptoms, including panic attacks, difficulty controlling worry, and intense fear.

Men typically learn they are affected between ages 20-40 when being evaluated for infertility and are found to have no sperm production (azoospermia). The diagnosis is made based on testicular biopsy findings. Other signs and symptoms are rare, but are secondary to the underlying condition causing SCO syndrome. Most cases are idiopathic (of unknown cause), but causes may include deletions in the azoospermia factor (AZF) region of the Y chromosome, or Y-chromosome microdeletions (referred to as Y chromosome infertility); Klinefelter syndrome; exposure to chemicals and toxins; history of radiation therapy; and history of severe trauma. There is not currently a known effective treatment for the condition. When no germ cells are visible in any seminiferous tubules it is considered SCO type I; if germ cells are present in a minority of tubules is it considered SCO type II.", "predict": "Sertoli cell-only syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of male reproductive organs. It is characterized by the presence of Sertoli cells in the testes, but the absence of germ cells. This leads to the absence of sperm production and infertility in affected males. Sertoli cells play a crucial role in the development of the testes and are responsible for supporting the development of sperm in the testes. Without sperm production, individuals with Sertoli cell-only syndrome are unable to reproduce.\n\nSertoli cell-only syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that males inherit the defective gene from their mothers. It is estimated that 1 in every 200 to 300 male births in the United States is affected by Sertoli cell-only syndrome. The condition is more common in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews and the Amish population."}

Contractions let you know labor is starting. When contractions are five minutes apart, your body is ready to push the baby out.    During the first stage of labor, your cervix slowly opens, or dilates, to about 4 inches wide. At the same time, it becomes thinner. This is called effacement. You shouldn't push until your uterus is fully effaced and dilated. When it is, the baby delivery stage starts. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward, your baby is born. The placenta that nourished the baby follows.    Mothers and babies are monitored closely during labor. Most women are healthy enough to have a baby through normal vaginal delivery, meaning that the baby comes down the birth canal without surgery. If there are complications, the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.     Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health", "predict": "Childbirth, also known as labor and delivery, is a transformative experience for both the mother and the baby. It is a journey that begins with the first signs of labor and culminates in the birth of a healthy baby. During this process, the mother's body undergoes significant changes to accommodate the growth of the baby, leading to a variety of physical and emotional responses. Labor is characterized by regular contractions that cause the cervix to dilate, leading to the eventual expulsion of the baby. While the mother's body is preparing for childbirth, it is essential to provide proper support and guidance to ensure a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and baby."}

Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\n                \nThe heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.\n                \nThe septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum.\n                \nA hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).\n                \nASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body.\n                \nOver the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs and VSDs have greatly improved. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired.", "predict": "Holes in the heart are congenital heart defects that occur during fetal development. They are caused by an abnormal opening in the septum, a wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart. This abnormal opening can lead to various complications, including blood flow through the septum in the wrong direction, blood mixing, and the mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood. Some of the more common types of holes in the heart include atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and atrioventricular canal defect.\n\nAtrial septal defect is the most common type of hole in the heart, where there is an abnormal opening between the two upper chambers of the heart, the atria. This defect allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium, causing mixing of blood. Ventricular septal defect, on the other hand, is a hole in the wall between the two lower chambers of the heart, the ventricles. This defect allows blood to flow from the right ventricle to the left ventricle, mixing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood.\n\nPatent ductus arteriosus is another type of hole in the heart, where the ductus arteriosus, a blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery and the aorta, fails to close after birth. This defect allows blood to flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs and causing a shunt of blood. Atrioventricular canal defect is a rare condition where there is an abnormal opening between the atria and ventricles, allowing blood to flow between the two chambers.\n\nHoles in the heart can be detected during pregnancy through fetal echocardiography. If a hole in the heart is identified, it is essential to follow up with a pediatric cardiologist to determine the appropriate treatment plan. Treatment options may include surgery, medication, or a combination of both, depending on the severity of the defect and the child's overall health."}

You can do it in any clean, well-lit place. The time period that the dialysis solution is in your belly is called the dwell time. With continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the dialysis solution stays in your belly for a dwell time of 4 to 6 hours, or more. Each exchange takes about 30 to 40 minutes. During an exchange, you can read, talk, watch television, or sleep. Usually, you change the dialysis solution at least four times a day and sleep with solution in your belly at night. You do not have to wake up and perform exchanges during the night.  - Automated peritoneal dialysis uses a machine called a cycler to fill and empty your belly three to five times during the night while you sleep. In the morning, you begin one exchange with a daylong dwell time. You may do an additional exchange around the middle of the afternoon without the cycler to increase the amount of waste removed and reduce the amount of fluid left behind in your body.\n                \nIf you weigh more than 175 pounds or if your peritoneum filters wastes slowly, you may need a combination of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis.

It is a treatment method for kidney failure, which occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter waste products from the blood. Kidney failure can be caused by various factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nDuring PD, a sterile solution is infused into the abdominal cavity, allowing waste products to diffuse through the lining of the abdomen and into the bloodstream. The solution is then drained from the abdomen, carrying away waste products and excess fluid. PD can be performed at home or in a hospital setting, depending on the individual's needs.\n\nOne advantage of PD is that it allows the patient to maintain a more normal lifestyle, as it does not require the use of needles or catheters. Additionally, PD can be adjusted to meet the individual's needs, making it a versatile and effective treatment option for kidney failure."}

The cornea is made up of several layers of tissue, and in lattice corneal dystrophy type I, the deposits form in the stromal layer. The amyloid deposits form as delicate, branching fibers that create a lattice pattern.  Affected individuals often have recurrent corneal erosions, which are caused by separation of particular layers of the cornea from one another. Corneal erosions are very painful and can cause sensitivity to bright light (photophobia). Lattice corneal dystrophy type I is usually bilateral, which means it affects both eyes. The condition becomes apparent in childhood or adolescence and leads to vision problems by early adulthood.", "predict": "Lattice corneal dystrophy type I is a genetic condition that affects the cornea, the clear front part of the eye. Individuals with lattice corneal dystrophy type I typically have no symptoms in their early years. However, as they grow older, they may experience vision problems such as blurry vision, glare, and difficulty seeing at night. This condition is characterized by the presence of small, fine, yellow-white lines on the cornea. These lines are often mistaken for age spots or freckles, but they are actually part of the dystrophy.\n\nIt is important to note that while lattice corneal dystrophy type I does not affect vision initially, it can lead to vision loss as the condition progresses.

These abnormalities result from problems with the formation of one or more parts of the heart during the early stages of embryonic development. CCHD prevents the heart from pumping blood effectively or reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. As a result, organs and tissues throughout the body do not receive enough oxygen, which can lead to organ damage and life-threatening complications. Individuals with CCHD usually require surgery soon after birth.  Although babies with CCHD may appear healthy for the first few hours or days of life, signs and symptoms soon become apparent. These can include an abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur), rapid breathing (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), and a blue or purple tint to the skin caused by a shortage of oxygen (cyanosis). If untreated, CCHD can lead to shock, coma, and death. However, most people with CCHD now survive past infancy due to improvements in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.  Some people with treated CCHD have few related health problems later in life. However, long-term effects of CCHD can include delayed development and reduced stamina during exercise. Adults with these heart defects have an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and premature death.  Each of the heart defects associated with CCHD affects the flow of blood into, out of, or through the heart. Some of the heart defects involve structures within the heart itself, such as the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) or the valves that control blood flow through the heart. Others affect the structure of the large blood vessels leading into and out of the heart (including the aorta and pulmonary artery). Still others involve a combination of these structural abnormalities.  People with CCHD have one or more specific heart defects. The heart defects classified as CCHD include coarctation of the aorta, double-outlet right ventricle, D-transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.", "predict": "Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) refers to a condition that affects the heart of a newborn baby.

The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor. Rh-negative people don't have it. Rh factor is inherited though genes.    When you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance. It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.    But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies, if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. The baby could get Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.    Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. If treatment is needed for the baby, it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute", "predict": "Rh incompatibility is a condition where the Rh blood type of a pregnant woman is not compatible with that of her unborn child. The Rh factor is a protein found on the surface of red blood cells that helps in the blood clotting process. In Rh incompatibility, the Rh factor is not present in the mother's blood, while it is present in the blood of the unborn child. This mismatch between the Rh factor in the mother and child can lead to complications during pregnancy, including:\n\n1. Anemia: The mother may develop anemia due to the presence of anti-Rh antibodies in her blood. These antibodies can destroy the red blood cells of the unborn child, causing anemia.\n\n2. Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN): In HDN, the anti-Rh antibodies in the mother's blood can cross the placenta and attack the red blood cells of the unborn child. This can lead to severe anemia, jaundice, and brain damage in the newborn.\n\n3. Miscarriage: In some cases, Rh incompatibility can lead to miscarriage or premature delivery.\n\n4. Stillbirth: In rare cases, Rh incompatibility can lead to stillbirth.\n\nTo prevent complications associated with Rh incompatibility, it is important for pregnant women to receive the Rh immune globulin injection if they have Rh negative blood type and their partner has Rh positive blood type. This injection helps protect the mother's blood from producing anti-Rh antibodies and reduces the risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies. It is recommended that all pregnant women receive this injection during their first prenatal visit to ensure the safety of their unborn child."}

Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers and have a large head. Other signs and symptoms may include intellectual disability; behavioral problems; problems with speech and language; and/or weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Sotos syndrome is usually caused by a mutation in the NSD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 95% of cases are due to a new mutation in the affected person and occur sporadically (are not inherited).", "predict": "Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a significant increase in body size and rapid growth in children. Children with Sotos syndrome often appear to be larger than their age. This condition is caused by changes (mutations) in the gene encoding the protein NIPA1. Mutations in this gene lead to an overproduction of the NIPA1 protein, which can disrupt the normal development of the brain, causing symptoms of Sotos syndrome. Additionally, Sotos syndrome is associated with developmental delays, learning disabilities, and a high incidence of autism spectrum disorder.\n\nThe hallmark feature of Sotos syndrome is macrocephaly, which refers to an abnormally large head size. In children with Sotos syndrome, the head circumference is typically at least 3 standard deviations above the mean for age. Macrocephaly can be present at birth, but it is more commonly seen in infants with Sotos syndrome as they grow older.\n\nIn addition to macrocephaly, children with Sotos syndrome may experience various other symptoms such as short stature, large hands and feet, abnormal facial features, and a high-pitched voice. Some individuals with Sotos syndrome may also have a condition called Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by a range of physical and developmental abnormalities. While the exact prevalence of Sotos syndrome is unknown, it is estimated to affect around 1 in 20,000 live births.\n\nSotos syndrome is a complex disorder that requires a comprehensive approach to treatment.

You may need it if you have been badly burned, have liver failure or a severe infection.       Most blood transfusions go very smoothly. Some infectious agents, such as HIV, can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe, blood banks carefully screen donated blood. The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is low.    Sometimes it is possible to have a transfusion of your own blood. During surgery, you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss. If you are having a surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance, your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood, instead of donated blood.

A hydatidiform mole occurs early in pregnancy when an embryo does not fully develop and the placenta develops abnormally. The placenta is a solid structure in the uterus that normally provides nutrients to a growing fetus. If a hydatidiform mole occurs once, it is known a sporadic hydatidiform mole; if it happens again, the condition is known as recurrent hydatidiform mole.  A hydatidiform mole often causes vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of the pregnancy. In an ultrasound examination, the abnormal placenta appears as numerous small sacs, often described as resembling a bunch of grapes. In some cases, the ultrasound shows no fetus, umbilical cord, or amniotic sac (a fluid-filled sac that normally surrounds the fetus).  Hydatidiform moles are not naturally discharged from the body and must be surgically removed, typically by the end of the first trimester. After removal, there is up to a 20 percent risk that any tissue left behind (persistent mole) will continue to grow and become a cancerous tumor called an invasive mole. The invasive mole can transform into a different form of cancer called gestational choriocarcinoma that can spread (metastasize) to other tissues such as the liver, lungs, or brain.", "predict": "Recurrent hydatidiform mole (RHM) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of hydatidiform moles, which are abnormal masses of placental tissue that may appear in the uterus.

The eye problems in Peters plus syndrome occur in an area at the front part of the eye known as the anterior segment. The anterior segment consists of structures including the lens, the colored part of the eye (iris), and the clear covering of the eye (cornea). An eye problem called Peters anomaly is the most common anterior segment abnormality seen in Peters plus syndrome. Peters anomaly involves abnormal development of the anterior segment, which results in a cornea that is cloudy (opaque) and causes blurred vision. Peters anomaly may also be associated with clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts) or other lens abnormalities. Peters anomaly is usually bilateral, which means that it affects both eyes. The severity of corneal clouding and other eye problems can vary between individuals with Peters plus syndrome, even among members of the same family. Many people with Peters plus syndrome experience vision loss that worsens over time.  All people with Peters plus syndrome have short stature, which is evident before birth.

People with CVID are highly susceptible to infection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, or more rarely, viruses and often develop recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Pneumonia is common in people with CVID. Over time, recurrent infections can lead to chronic lung disease. Affected individuals may also experience infection or inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause diarrhea and weight loss. Abnormal accumulation of immune cells causes enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) in some people with CVID. Immune cells can accumulate in other organs, forming small lumps called granulomas.  Approximately 25 percent of people with CVID have an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. The blood cells are most frequently affected by autoimmune attacks in CVID; the most commonly occurring autoimmune disorders are immune thrombocytopenia purpura, which is an abnormal bleeding disorder caused by a decrease in platelets, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which results in premature destruction of red blood cells. Other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can occur. Individuals with CVID also have a greater than normal risk of developing certain types of cancer, including a cancer of immune system cells called non-Hodgkin lymphoma and less frequently, stomach (gastric) cancer.

This disorder primarily affects the liver, pancreas, and heart. Iron overload in the liver leads to cirrhosis, which can cause liver failure and death. The pancreas may be affected, leading to diabetes. Additionally, heart damage can occur due to iron deposition in the heart muscle.\n\nIn hemochromatosis type 1, there is a mutation in the HFE gene that results in the body being unable to regulate iron absorption from the gut. This leads to increased iron levels in the body, with up to 90% of the iron being deposited in the liver. As a result, people with hemochromatosis type 1 can develop a wide range of symptoms, including:\n\n1. Hepatomegaly: Enlargement of the liver due to iron overload\n\n2. Arthropathy: Joint pain and stiffness due to deposition of iron in the joints\n\n3. Diabetes: Iron deposition in the pancreas can lead to diabetes\n\n4.

The neural tube is a narrow channel that normally folds and closes between the 3rd and 4th weeks of pregnancy, forming the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Anencephaly occurs when the 'cephalic' or head end of the neural tube fails to close, causing the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Infants with this disorder are born without a forebrain (the front part of the brain) and a cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating part of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed (not covered by bone or skin). Affected babies are usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth, although some may survive a few hours or a few days after birth. Anencephaly is likely caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown.", "predict": "Anencephaly is a condition that affects the development of the brain and skull in the fetus during pregnancy.

This tissue is made of trophoblast cells and normally surrounds the fertilized egg in the uterus. Trophoblast cells help connect the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus and form part of the placenta (the organ that passes nutrients from the mother to the fetus).   Sometimes there is a problem with the fertilized egg and trophoblast cells. Instead of a healthy fetus developing, a tumor forms. Until there are signs or symptoms of the tumor, the pregnancy will seem like a normal pregnancy.   Most GTD is benign (not cancer) and does not spread, but some types become malignant (cancer) and spread to nearby tissues or distant parts of the body.   Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a general term that includes different types of disease:         -  Hydatidiform Moles (HM)               - Complete HM.      - Partial HM.             - Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)               -  Invasive moles.      -  Choriocarcinomas.      - Placental-site trophoblastic tumors (PSTT; very rare).      - Epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ETT; even more rare).\n                \n                \n                    Hydatidiform mole (HM) is the most common type of GTD.\n                    HMs are slow-growing tumors that look like sacs of fluid. An HM is also called a molar pregnancy. The cause of hydatidiform moles is not known.   HMs may be complete or partial:         - A complete HM forms when sperm fertilizes an egg that does not contain the mothers DNA. The egg has DNA from the father and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.    - A partial HM forms when sperm fertilizes a normal egg and there are two sets of DNA from the father in the fertilized egg. Only part of the fetus forms and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.        Most hydatidiform moles are benign, but they sometimes become cancer. Having one or more of the following risk factors increases the risk that a hydatidiform mole will become cancer:         - A pregnancy before 20 or after 35 years of age.    - A very high level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG), a hormone made by the body during pregnancy.    - A large tumor in the uterus.     - An ovarian cyst larger than 6 centimeters.     -  High blood pressure during pregnancy.    - An overactive thyroid gland (extra thyroid hormone is made).    - Severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.    - Trophoblastic cells in the blood, which may block small blood vessels.     - Serious blood clotting problems caused by the HM.\n                \n                \n                    Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) that is almost always malignant.\n                    Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) includes the following:     Invasive moles    Invasive moles are made up of trophoblast cells that grow into the muscle layer of the uterus. Invasive moles are more likely to grow and spread than a hydatidiform mole. Rarely, a complete or partial HM may become an invasive mole. Sometimes an invasive mole will disappear without treatment.       Choriocarcinomas    A choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that forms from trophoblast cells and spreads to the muscle layer of the uterus and nearby blood vessels. It may also spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, intestines, pelvis, or vagina. A choriocarcinoma is more likely to form in women who have had any of the following:            -  Molar pregnancy, especially with a complete hydatidiform mole.      - Normal pregnancy.     - Tubal pregnancy (the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus).     - Miscarriage.              Placental-site trophoblastic tumors    A placental-site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) is a rare type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that forms where the placenta attaches to the uterus. The tumor forms from trophoblast cells and spreads into the muscle of the uterus and into blood vessels. It may also spread to the lungs, pelvis, or lymph nodes. A PSTT grows very slowly and signs or symptoms may appear months or years after a normal pregnancy.        Epithelioid trophoblastic tumors    An epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) is a very rare type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that may be benign or malignant. When the tumor is malignant, it may spread to the lungs.", "predict": "Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) refers to a group of conditions that affect the placenta during pregnancy. It is a type of cancer that arises from the placental tissue. GTD is categorized into two main types: gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and gestational trophoblastic disease without neoplasia (GTD-WN). GTN encompasses invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumor, while GTD-WN includes placental site trophoblastic tumor, placental site epithelioid trophoblastic tumor, and other trophoblastic tumors.\n\nInvasive mole is a malignant condition that arises from the trophoblastic tissue and can invade the uterus. Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant form of GTN that can metastasize to various organs in the body. Placental site trophoblastic tumor is a rare type of GTN that typically arises from the placental site. Gestational trophoblastic disease without neoplasia, on the other hand, includes placental site trophoblastic tumor, placental site epithelioid trophoblastic tumor, and other trophoblastic tumors that do not involve neoplasia.\n\nThe treatment for GTD varies depending on the type and severity of the disease. Invasive mole and choriocarcinoma are typically treated with chemotherapy, while placental site trophoblastic tumor may require surgery.

The gonads direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. The adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys, regulate the production of certain hormones and control salt levels in the body. People with 3-HSD deficiency lack many of the hormones that are made in these glands. 3-HSD deficiency is one of a group of disorders known as congenital adrenal hyperplasias that impair hormone production and disrupt sexual development and maturation.  There are three types of 3-HSD deficiency: the salt-wasting, non-salt-wasting, and non-classic types. In the salt-wasting type, hormone production is extremely low. Individuals with this type lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening. Individuals affected with the salt-wasting type are usually diagnosed soon after birth due to complications related to a lack of salt reabsorption, including dehydration, poor feeding, and vomiting. People with the non-salt-wasting type of 3-HSD deficiency produce enough hormone to allow sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. Individuals with the non-classic type have the mildest symptoms and do not experience salt wasting.  In males with any type of 3-HSD deficiency, problems with male sex hormones lead to abnormalities of the external genitalia. These abnormalities range from having the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) to having external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). The severity of the genital abnormality does not consistently depend on the type of the condition. Because of the hormone dysfunction in the testes, males with 3-HSD deficiency are frequently unable to have biological children (infertile).  Females with 3-HSD deficiency may have slight abnormalities of the external genitalia at birth. Females affected with the non-salt-wasting or non-classic types are typically not diagnosed until mid-childhood or puberty, when they may experience irregular menstruation, premature pubic hair growth, and excessive body hair growth (hirsutism).

The exact cause of gigantomastia has not been determined. Nonetheless, the following theories have been proposed to explain gigantomastia: (1) end-organ hypersensitivity (a condition in which the breast tissue is more sensitive to hormones circulating in the body), (2) autoimmune issues, (3) high IGF-1 (insulin growth factor-1, a hormone involved in regulating bone growth) and (4) hyperprolactanemia (high levels of prolactin). Gigantomastia has been noted as a side effect of treatment with certain medications like D-pencillamine and in one case as an apparently hereditary condition. Symptoms of gigantomastic may include mastalgia (breast pain), ulceration/infection, posture problems, back pain and chronic traction injury to 4th/5th/6th intercostal nerves with resultant loss of nipple sensation.

Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.     There are low levels of radon outdoors. Indoors, there can be high levels. Radon can enter homes and buildings through cracks in floors, walls, or foundations. Radon can also be in your water, especially well water. Testing is the only way to know if your home has elevated radon levels. It is inexpensive and easy. You can buy a test kit at most hardware stores or hire someone to do a test. Radon reduction systems can bring the amount of radon down to a safe level. The cost depends on the size and design of your home.", "predict": "Radon is a radioactive gas that can seep into homes and buildings from the ground. It is a major cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. Radon is naturally occurring and is present in all soils, with higher levels found in areas where there is an abundance of uranium. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that about 1 in 15 homes in the United States has an indoor radon level that is higher than the EPA action level of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). This means that there is a risk of exposure to radon, especially in homes with higher radon levels.\n\nRadon levels in homes can be measured using a radon test kit. The kit is inserted into a home's lowest level for a set period, typically 48 hours, and the results are analyzed to determine the radon level. If the radon level is above the EPA action level, it is important to take steps to reduce the radon level in the home.\n\nOne effective way to reduce radon levels in homes is through the use of a radon mitigation system. This system involves installing a vent pipe that draws radon from the ground and releases it to the outside. The vent pipe is typically installed in the basement or crawl space of the home, where radon is most likely to accumulate.\n\nAnother way to reduce radon levels in homes is through the use of a radon reduction system. This system involves sealing off the radon source in the home, such as by sealing cracks in the foundation or sealing off the crawl space. The radon reduction system can be effective in reducing radon levels, but it may not be suitable for all homes.\n\nIn conclusion, radon is a serious health concern that can lead to lung cancer in non-smokers. It is important to take steps to measure and reduce radon levels in homes, such as by using radon test kits and radon mitigation or reduction systems. By taking these steps, individuals can help protect themselves and their families from the harmful effects of radon."}

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is one form of a broader condition known as pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension occurs when most of the very small arteries throughout the lungs narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. To overcome the increased resistance, blood pressure increases in the pulmonary artery and in the right ventricle of the heart, which is the chamber that pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. Ultimately, the increased blood pressure can damage the right ventricle of the heart.  Signs and symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension occur when increased blood pressure cannot fully overcome the elevated resistance. As a result, the flow of oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body is insufficient. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exertion and fainting spells are the most common symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. People with this disorder may experience additional symptoms, particularly as the condition worsens. Other symptoms include dizziness, swelling (edema) of the ankles or legs, chest pain, and a rapid heart rate.", "predict": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.

It contains immature cells, called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells, which fight infections, and platelets, which help the blood to clot.    A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that replaces a person's faulty bone marrow stem cells. Doctors use these transplants to treat people with certain diseases, such as       - Leukemia    - Severe blood diseases such as thalassemias, aplastic anemia, and sickle cell anemia    - Multiple myeloma    - Certain immune deficiency diseases       Before you have a transplant, you need to get high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation. This destroys the faulty stem cells in your bone marrow. It also suppresses your body's immune system so that it won't attack the new stem cells after the transplant.    In some cases, you can donate your own bone marrow stem cells in advance. The cells are saved and then used later on. Or you can get cells from a donor. The donor might be a family member or unrelated person.    Bone marrow transplantation has serious risks. Some complications can be life-threatening. But for some people, it is the best hope for a cure or a longer life.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute", "predict": "Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a medical procedure that involves removing bone marrow from the donor and transplanting it into the recipient. This procedure is used to treat certain types of blood cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, as well as other diseases. During a BMT, the recipient's bone marrow is destroyed with chemotherapy or radiation to create space for the donor's bone marrow to grow. The donor's bone marrow is typically obtained from the pelvic bone or hip bone and then transplanted into the recipient's body. This procedure aims to restore the production of healthy blood cells in the recipient's body. BMT is a complex and highly specialized procedure that requires a team of medical professionals to manage the process effectively."}

Affected individuals have a gradual loss of intellectual function (dementia), typically beginning in their thirties. In some people with this disorder, changes in personality become apparent before problems with thinking skills.  People with HSAN IE also develop hearing loss that is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). The hearing loss gets worse over time and usually progresses to moderate or severe deafness between the ages of 20 and 35.  HSAN IE is characterized by impaired function of nerve cells called sensory neurons, which transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch. Sensations in the feet and legs are particularly affected in people with HSAN IE. Gradual loss of sensation in the feet (peripheral neuropathy), which usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood, can lead to difficulty walking. Affected individuals may not be aware of injuries to their feet, which can lead to open sores and infections. If these complications are severe, amputation of the affected areas may be required.  HSAN IE is also characterized by a loss of the ability to sweat (sudomotor function), especially on the hands and feet. Sweating is a function of the autonomic nervous system, which also controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. These other autonomic functions are unaffected in people with HSAN IE.  The severity of the signs and symptoms of HSAN IE and their age of onset are variable, even within the same family.", "predict": "Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IE is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the autonomic nervous system.

Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body doesn't make enough insulin. This causes the body's blood sugar level to rise.\n                \nIn type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly (a condition called insulin resistance). At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, though, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\n                \nFor more information about diabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Introduction to Diabetes Web page.\n                \n\n                \nDHD may include coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee).\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nIn CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nPlaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\n                \nPlaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nCHD can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh), irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart attack, or even death.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. The term heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\n                \nIf you have heart failure, you may tire easily and have to limit your activities. CHD can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart muscle over time.\n                \nDiabetic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nDiabetic cardiomyopathy is a disease that damages the structure and function of the heart.

The higher a person's blood sugar level is, the higher his or her risk of DHD.\n                \nDiabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways.\n                \nFirst, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease, just like smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. In fact, people who have type 2 diabetes have the same risk of heart attack and dying from heart disease as people who already have had heart attacks.\n                \nSecond, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Although research is ongoing, it's clear that diabetes and other conditionssuch as overweight and obesity and metabolic syndromeinteract to cause harmful physical changes to the heart.\n                \nThird, diabetes raises the risk of earlier and more severe heart problems. Also, people who have DHD tend to have less success with some heart disease treatments, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention,also known as coronary angioplasty.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIf you have diabetes, you can lower your risk of DHD. Making lifestyle changes and taking prescribed medicines can help you prevent or control many risk factors.\n                \nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors. For example, physical activity can lower your blood pressure, help control your blood sugar level and your weight, and reduce stress.\n                \nIt's also very important to follow your treatment plan for diabetes and see your doctor for ongoing care.\n                \nIf you already have DHD, follow your treatment plan as your doctors advises. This may help you avoid or delay serious problems, such as a heart attack or heart failure.", "predict": "Diabetic Heart Disease refers to the heart condition that is more likely to develop in individuals with diabetes.

CHARGE stands for coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), retarded growth and development, genital abnormality, and ear abnormality. The pattern of malformations varies among individuals with this disorder, and infants often have multiple life-threatening medical conditions. The diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is based on a combination of major and minor characteristics.  The major characteristics of CHARGE syndrome are more specific to this disorder than are the minor characteristics. Many individuals with CHARGE syndrome have a hole in one of the structures of the eye (coloboma), which forms during early development. A coloboma may be present in one or both eyes and can affect a person's vision, depending on its size and location. Some people also have small eyes (microphthalmia). One or both nasal passages may be narrowed (choanal stenosis) or completely blocked (choanal atresia). Individuals with CHARGE syndrome frequently have cranial nerve abnormalities. The cranial nerves emerge directly from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck, controlling muscle movement and transmitting sensory information. Abnormal function of certain cranial nerves can cause swallowing problems, facial paralysis, a sense of smell that is diminished (hyposmia) or completely absent (anosmia), and mild to profound hearing loss. People with CHARGE syndrome also typically have middle and inner ear abnormalities and unusually shaped ears.  The minor characteristics of CHARGE syndrome are not specific to this disorder; they are frequently present in people without CHARGE syndrome. The minor characteristics include heart defects, slow growth starting in late infancy, developmental delay, and an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Individuals frequently have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. Males are often born with an unusually small penis (micropenis) and undescended testes (cryptorchidism). External genitalia abnormalities are seen less often in females with CHARGE syndrome. Puberty can be incomplete or delayed. Individuals may have a tracheoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea. People with CHARGE syndrome also have distinctive facial features, including a square-shaped face and difference in the appearance between the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Individuals have a wide range of cognitive function, from normal intelligence to major learning disabilities with absent speech and poor communication.", "predict": "CHARGE syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple parts of the body, including the heart, face, and nervous system.

The symptoms of this disorder usually become noticeable in a person's forties or fifties. Most affected people survive 5 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, although a few have survived for two decades or more.  Changes in personality and behavior are often early signs of FTDP-17. These changes include a loss of inhibition, inappropriate emotional responses, restlessness, neglect of personal hygiene, and a general loss of interest in activities and events. The disease also leads to deterioration of cognitive functions (dementia), including problems with judgment, planning, and concentration. Some people with FTDP-17 develop psychiatric symptoms, including obsessive-compulsive behaviors, delusions, and hallucinations. It may become difficult for affected individuals to interact with others in a socially appropriate manner. They increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living.  Many people with FTDP-17 develop problems with speech and language. They may have trouble finding words, confuse one word with another (semantic paraphasias), and repeat words spoken by others (echolalia). Difficulties with speech and language worsen over time, and most affected individuals eventually lose the ability to communicate.  FTDP-17 is also characterized by progressive problems with movement. Many affected individuals develop features of parkinsonism, including tremors, rigidity, and unusually slow movement (bradykinesia). As the disease progresses, most affected individuals become unable to walk. Some people with FTDP-17 also have restricted up-and-down eye movement (vertical gaze palsy) and rapid abnormal movements of both eyes (saccades).", "predict": "Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17) is a rare genetic form of dementia characterized by the combination of behavioral changes and cognitive decline. The behavioral changes typically seen in FTDP-17 include apathy, loss of motivation, disinhibition, and irritability. Additionally, individuals with FTDP-17 may experience problems with executive function, such as difficulty with planning and organizing tasks. These behavioral changes can make it challenging for individuals with FTDP-17 to engage in daily activities and interact with others.\n\nFTDP-17 is caused by mutations in the GRN gene, which encodes progranulin. Progranulin is a protein that plays a role in the regulation of cell growth and death. Mutations in the GRN gene lead to the production of abnormal progranulin proteins, which can disrupt normal brain function. These mutations can occur sporadically or be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\n\nEarly symptoms of FTDP-17 typically begin in middle age and may include changes in personality, emotional ability, and behavior. Over time, individuals with FTDP-17 may experience memory loss, difficulty with language and speech, and problems with movement and coordination. The progression of FTDP-17 can vary, with some individuals experiencing a relatively slow decline, while others may experience a more rapid decline.\n\nDiagnosis of FTDP-17 is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the GRN gene. Treatment for FTDP-17 is focused on managing symptoms and supporting individuals with the condition and their families. Supportive care, including medication management and therapy, can help individuals with FTDP-17 improve their quality of life and manage the challenges associated with the condition."}

Episodes of myoclonus may be brought on by physical exertion, stress, light, or other stimuli. Within 5 to 10 years, the myoclonic episodes may become severe enough to interfere with walking and other everyday activities.  Affected individuals also usually have seizures involving loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and convulsions (tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures). Like the myoclonic episodes, these may increase in frequency over several years but may be controlled with treatment. After several years of progression, the frequency of seizures may stabilize or decrease.  Eventually people with Unverricht-Lundborg disease may develop problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), involuntary rhythmic shaking that worsens during movement (intentional tremor), difficulty speaking (dysarthria), depression, and a slow, mild decline in intellectual functioning.

Without proper treatment, chronic acidity of the blood leads to growth retardation, kidney stones, bone disease, chronic kidney disease, and possibly total kidney failure.\n                \nThe body's cells use chemical reactions to carry out tasks such as turning food into energy and repairing tissue. These chemical reactions generate acids. Some acid in the blood is normal, but too much acidacidosiscan disturb many bodily functions. Healthy kidneys help maintain acid-base balance by excreting acids into the urine and returning bicarbonatean alkaline, or base, substanceto the blood. This \"reclaimed\" bicarbonate neutralizes much of the acid that is created when food is broken down in the body. The movement of substances like bicarbonate between the blood and structures in the kidneys is called transport.\n                \nOne researcher has theorized that Charles Dickens may have been describing a child with RTA in the character of Tiny Tim from A Christmas Carol. Tiny Tim's small stature, malformed limbs, and periods of weakness are all possible consequences of the chemical imbalance caused by RTA.1 In the story, Tiny Tim recovers when he receives medical treatment, which would likely have included sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate, alkaline agents to neutralize acidic blood. The good news is that medical treatment can indeed reverse the effects of RTA.", "predict": "Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) is a group of disorders characterized by a decrease in the body's ability to acidify the urine. This occurs due to a malfunction in the tubules of the kidneys, which are responsible for reabsorbing and excreting waste products.

There are several types of RTA, each with its own unique symptoms and underlying causes.\n\nType 1 RTA is the most common form of the disorder, and is characterized by the inability to acidify the urine. This type of RTA is often associated with other kidney disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease or Alport syndrome. In type 1 RTA, the affected person's urine has a pH level of around 5.5, which is significantly lower than the normal pH of 7.0. This low pH level can lead to metabolic acidosis, a condition in which the body has an excess of acid.\n\nType 2 RTA is characterized by an inability to excrete acid properly, resulting in a pH level of around 5.5 in the urine. This type of RTA is associated with a defect in the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb bicarbonate, which is necessary for the proper acidification of the urine. Type 2 RTA can be inherited or acquired, and may be accompanied by other kidney disorders such as polycystic kidney disease.\n\nType 3 RTA is characterized by a defect in the ability to reabsorb bicarbonate in the kidneys. This type of RTA is often associated with conditions such as cystinosis or Dent disease. In type 3 RTA, the urine has a pH level of around 6.0, which is slightly higher than in types 1 and 2 RTA.\n\nType 4 RTA is characterized by a defect in the ability to reabsorb bicarbonate in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. This type of RTA is associated with conditions such as Gitelman syndrome or Bartter syndrome. In type 4 RTA, the urine has a pH level of around 5.5, which is similar to type 1 RTA.\n\nIt is important to note that RTA can be a symptom of other kidney disorders, and may not be the sole cause of these conditions.

This gene mutation leads to an accumulation of lipids in cells, which can affect muscle function and cause the characteristic tremors associated with RMD.\n\nIndividuals with RMD may also experience muscle weakness, contractures, scoliosis, and cognitive impairment. The severity of RMD symptoms can vary significantly from person to person, with some individuals having mild symptoms that are only noticeable during exercise or with stress, while others may have more severe symptoms that significantly impact their daily life. Treatment for RMD primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications, such as scoliosis, through physical therapy and medication.\n\nIn conclusion, RMD is a complex genetic disorder that affects muscle function and can result in tremors, muscle weakness, contractures, scoliosis, and cognitive impairment. Understanding the causes and symptoms of RMD is crucial in providing appropriate care and support for individuals affected by this rare disorder."}

Low lipid levels may be caused by rare genetic conditions, or be a sign of another disorder such as overactive thyroid, anemia, undernutrition, cancer, chronic infection, or impaired absorption of foods from the digestive tract. Associated genetic disorders includes abetalipoproteinemia, hypobetalipoproteinemia, and chylomicron retention disease. Symptoms of the genetic or familial form of hypolipoproteinemia varies. In hypobetalipoproteinemia the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are very low, yet people with this syndrome typically have no symptoms nor require treatment. Other forms result in absent or near absent LDL levels and can cause serious symptoms in infancy and early childhood.", "predict": "Hypolipoproteinemia is a condition characterized by low levels of lipoproteins in the blood. Lipoproteins are particles that transport fats, such as cholesterol, throughout the body. In hypolipoproteinemia, the levels of lipoproteins in the blood are lower than normal. This condition can lead to an accumulation of fat in the blood, which can increase the risk of developing conditions like high cholesterol, heart disease, and atherosclerosis.\n\nThere are several types of hypolipoproteinemia, each with its own specific characteristics. The most common type is familial hypolipoproteinemia, which is caused by a genetic defect in the production of lipoproteins. Other types of hypolipoproteinemia include hypobetalipoproteinemia, which is characterized by low levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol, and hypolipoproteinemia due to liver disease, which is associated with liver problems.\n\nTreatment for hypolipoproteinemia depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet and regular exercise may be sufficient to manage the condition. In others, medications or dietary supplements may be necessary to raise lipoprotein levels and improve overall health. It is important for individuals with hypolipoproteinemia to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan and manage their condition effectively."}

In people with this condition, abnormal lipid metabolism causes harmful amounts of lipids to accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain. Niemann-Pick disease type A appears during infancy and is characterized by an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and progressive deterioration of the nervous system. Due to the involvement of the nervous system, Niemann-Pick disease type A is also known as the neurological type. There is currently no effective treatment for this condition and those who are affected generally do not survive past early childhood. Niemann-Pick disease type A is caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.", "predict": "Niemann-Pick disease type A is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system.

Affected bones may be misshapen and easily broken (fractured).  The classic form of Paget disease of bone typically appears in middle age or later. It usually occurs in one or a few bones and does not spread from one bone to another. Any bones can be affected, although the disease most commonly affects bones in the spine, pelvis, skull, or legs.  Many people with classic Paget disease of bone do not experience any symptoms associated with their bone abnormalities. The disease is often diagnosed unexpectedly by x-rays or laboratory tests done for other reasons. People who develop symptoms are most likely to experience pain. The affected bones may themselves be painful, or pain may be caused by arthritis in nearby joints. Arthritis results when the distortion of bones, particularly weight-bearing bones in the legs, causes extra wear and tear on the joints. Arthritis most frequently affects the knees and hips in people with this disease.  Other complications of Paget disease of bone depend on which bones are affected. If the disease occurs in bones of the skull, it can cause an enlarged head, hearing loss, headaches, and dizziness. If the disease affects bones in the spine, it can lead to numbness and tingling (due to pinched nerves) and abnormal spinal curvature. In the leg bones, the disease can cause bowed legs and difficulty walking.  A rare type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma has been associated with Paget disease of bone. This type of cancer probably occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 people with this disease.  Early-onset Paget disease of bone is a less common form of the disease that appears in a person's teens or twenties. Its features are similar to those of the classic form of the disease, although it is more likely to affect the skull, spine, and ribs (the axial skeleton) and the small bones of the hands. The early-onset form of the disorder is also associated with hearing loss early in life.", "predict": "Paget disease of bone is a condition that primarily affects the bones, although it can also affect other organs such as the brain, thyroid, heart, and stomach. The disease is characterized by abnormal bone growth, leading to an increase in the size and density of the bones. This can result in fractures and deformities. Additionally, Paget disease of bone can cause a buildup of calcium in the bones, leading to bone pain, weakness, and deformities.\n\nOne of the main symptoms of Paget disease of bone is bone pain, which can be severe and occur in multiple areas of the body. The pain is often described as a dull ache or throbbing sensation. In addition to bone pain, Paget disease of bone can also cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and joint stiffness. These symptoms can vary in severity and may be present in different parts of the body.\n\nIn some cases, Paget disease of bone can lead to fractures, particularly in the hips, vertebrae, and bones in the hands and feet. These fractures can be more likely to occur in individuals with Paget disease of bone and may be more difficult to heal. Additionally, Paget disease of bone can cause deformities in the bones, such as a curved spine or misshapen bones in the hands or feet.\n\nIt is important to note that Paget disease of bone can also affect other organs in addition to the bones. The thyroid, heart, and stomach can all be affected by Paget disease of bone, leading to symptoms such as heart palpitations, thyroid dysfunction, and stomach pain. These symptoms can vary in severity and may be present in individuals with Paget disease of bone.\n\nTreatment for Paget disease of bone typically involves medications to slow down the progression of the disease and reduce symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to address specific complications caused by Paget disease of bone. It is important for individuals with Paget disease of bone to work closely with healthcare professionals to manage their symptoms and prevent complications.\n\nOverall, Paget disease of bone is a complex condition that can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life.

The disorder is characterized by red, raw, and blistered areas of skin that occur most often in skin folds, such as the groin, armpits, neck, and under the breasts. These inflamed areas can become crusty or scaly and may itch and burn. The skin problems tend to worsen with exposure to moisture (such as sweat), friction, and hot weather.  The severity of benign chronic pemphigus varies from relatively mild episodes of skin irritation to widespread, persistent areas of raw and blistered skin that interfere with daily activities. Affected skin may become infected with bacteria or fungi, leading to pain and odor. Although the condition is described as \"benign\" (noncancerous), in rare cases the skin lesions may develop into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.  Many affected individuals also have white lines running the length of their fingernails. These lines do not cause any problems, but they can be useful for diagnosing benign chronic pemphigus.", "predict": "Benign chronic pemphigus is a rare form of skin blistering disease characterized by the development of blisters on the skin. These blisters can be either single or multiple, and may appear on any part of the body. The blisters are typically painless and may rupture, leaving a sore on the skin. It is believed that benign chronic pemphigus is caused by an abnormal immune response, leading to the development of blisters.\n\nSymptoms of benign chronic pemphigus can vary in severity and may include itching, burning, tingling, or pain at the site of the blisters. The blisters may be filled with fluid or blood, and may be accompanied by redness, swelling, and tenderness.

Cancer and inflammatory disorders, in which abnormal activation of the immune system occurs, can also cause AI/ACD.\n                \nAI/ACD is easily confused with iron-deficiency anemia because in both forms of anemia levels of iron circulating in the blood are low. Iron in the body is found both circulating in the blood and stored in body tissues. Circulating iron is necessary for red blood cell production. Low blood iron levels occur in iron-deficiency anemia because levels of the iron stored in the bodys tissues are depleted. In AI/ACD, however, iron stores are normal or high. Low blood iron levels occur in AI/ACD, despite normal iron stores, because inflammatory and chronic diseases interfere with the bodys ability to use stored iron and absorb iron from the diet. AI/ACD is the second most common form of anemia, after iron-deficiency anemia.1", "predict": "Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is a condition characterized by low red blood cell count, which can be caused by chronic inflammation or underlying chronic disease. In both cases, the body's response to inflammation leads to decreased iron absorption and increased iron loss. This imbalance results in decreased red blood cell production, ultimately leading to anemia. Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease can be effectively managed through proper nutrition and iron supplementation. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent complications associated with anemia."}

Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged. IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both. In the past, IBS was called colitis, mucous colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, and spastic bowel. The name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a persons imagination.\n                \nIBS is diagnosed when a child who is growing as expected has abdominal pain or discomfort once per week for at least 2 months without other disease or injury that could explain the pain. The pain or discomfort of IBS may occur with a change in stool frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement.", "predict": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in children is a condition that affects the digestive system. It can cause abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. IBS in children is not life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and disrupt daily life. Children with IBS may experience abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. While the exact cause of IBS in children is not fully understood, it is believed to be due to a combination of factors, including genetics, the immune system, and the nervous system.\n\nTreatment for IBS in children typically involves managing symptoms with lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, and medications as needed.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is (are) pulmonary veno-occlusive disease?\n\n### Response:\n", "label": "Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is characterized by the blockage (occlusion) of the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood from the lungs to the heart (the pulmonary veins). The occlusion is caused by a buildup of abnormal fibrous tissue in the small veins in the lungs, which narrows the vessels and impairs blood flow. Because blood flow through the lungs is difficult, pressure rises in the vessels that carry blood that needs to be oxygenated to the lungs from the heart (the pulmonary arteries). Increased pressure in these vessels is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension.  The problems with blood flow in PVOD also impair the delivery of oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, which leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) and tiredness (fatigue) during exertion are the most common symptoms of this condition. Other common features include dizziness, a lack of energy (lethargy), difficulty breathing when lying down, and a cough that does not go away. As the condition worsens, affected individuals can develop a bluish tint to the skin (cyanosis), chest pains, fainting spells, and an accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema).  Certain features commonly seen in people with PVOD can be identified using a test called a CT scan. One of these features, which is seen in the lungs of affected individuals, is an abnormality described as centrilobular ground-glass opacities. Affected individuals also have abnormal thickening of certain tissues in the lungs, which is described as septal lines. In addition, lymph nodes in the chest (mediastinal lymph nodes) are abnormally enlarged in people with PVOD.  PVOD can begin at any age, and the blood flow problems worsen over time. Because of the increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, the heart must work harder than normal to pump blood to the lungs, which can eventually lead to fatal heart failure. Most people with this severe disorder do not live more than 2 years after diagnosis.", "predict": "Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare lung disease that occurs when the tiny blood vessels (venues) in the lungs become blocked. The blockage prevents blood from flowing normally and leads to fluid buildup in the lungs. This fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. Additionally, PVOD can lead to right-sided heart failure, which can further exacerbate symptoms. If left untreated, PVOD can lead to lung failure and death.\n\nPVOD is a progressive disease that typically affects women in their 40s or 50s. It is a form of pulmonary hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. There are several underlying causes of PVOD, including genetic mutations, infections, and exposure to toxins such as silica.\n\nTreatment for PVOD often involves the use of diuretics, medications that help the body get rid of excess fluid, as well as blood thinners to prevent blood clots. In some cases, a heart-lung transplant may be necessary to manage the disease. It is important for individuals with PVOD to work closely with a healthcare provider to manage their symptoms and maintain a high quality of life."}

Autonomic neuropathy also affects other internal organs, causing problems with digestion, respiratory function, urination, sexual response, and vision. In addition, the system that restores blood glucose levels to normal after a hypoglycemic episode may be affected, resulting in loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n                \nHypoglycemia Unawareness\n                \nNormally, symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, and palpitations occur when blood glucose levels drop below 70 mg/dL. In people with autonomic neuropathy, symptoms may not occur, making hypoglycemia difficult to recognize. Problems other than neuropathy can also cause hypoglycemia unawareness.\n                \nHeart and Blood Vessels\n                \nThe heart and blood vessels are part of the cardiovascular system, which controls blood circulation. Damage to nerves in the cardiovascular system interferes with the body's ability to adjust blood pressure and heart rate. As a result, blood pressure may drop sharply after sitting or standing, causing a person to feel light-headed or even to faint. Damage to the nerves that control heart rate can mean that the heart rate stays high, instead of rising and falling in response to normal body functions and physical activity.\n                \nDigestive System\n                \nNerve damage to the digestive system most commonly causes constipation. Damage can also cause the stomach to empty too slowly, a condition called gastroparesis. Severe gastroparesis can lead to persistent nausea and vomiting, bloating, and loss of appetite. Gastroparesis can also make blood glucose levels fluctuate widely, due to abnormal food digestion.\n                \nNerve damage to the esophagus may make swallowing difficult, while nerve damage to the bowels can cause constipation alternating with frequent, uncontrolled diarrhea, especially at night. Problems with the digestive system can lead to weight loss.\n                \nUrinary Tract and Sex Organs\n                \nAutonomic neuropathy often affects the organs that control urination and sexual function. Nerve damage can prevent the bladder from emptying completely, allowing bacteria to grow in the bladder and kidneys and causing urinary tract infections. When the nerves of the bladder are damaged, urinary incontinence may result because a person may not be able to sense when the bladder is full or control the muscles that release urine.\n                \nAutonomic neuropathy can also gradually decrease sexual response in men and women, although the sex drive may be unchanged. A man may be unable to have erections or may reach sexual climax without ejaculating normally. A woman may have difficulty with arousal, lubrication, or orgasm.\n                \nSweat Glands\n                \nAutonomic neuropathy can affect the nerves that control sweating. When nerve damage prevents the sweat glands from working properly, the body cannot regulate its temperature as it should. Nerve damage can also cause profuse sweating at night or while eating.\n                \nEyes\n                \nFinally, autonomic neuropathy can affect the pupils of the eyes, making them less responsive to changes in light. As a result, a person may not be able to see well when a light is turned on in a dark room or may have trouble driving at night.", "predict": "Diabetic neuropathies refer to a group of conditions caused by nerve damage associated with diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels, leading to damage to various parts of the body, including the nerves. Diabetes-related nerve damage can affect the peripheral nerves, which connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. This damage may result in various symptoms depending on the type of neuropathy involved.\n\nOne common type of diabetic neuropathy is peripheral neuropathy, which can affect the feet, hands, arms, legs, and even the autonomic nerves that regulate functions such as digestion and heart rate. Peripheral neuropathy can cause symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning pain, and loss of sensation in the affected areas. Over time, untreated peripheral neuropathy can lead to foot ulcers, which can be life-threatening if not treated properly.\n\nIn addition to peripheral neuropathy, there are other types of diabetic neuropathies that can affect different parts of the body. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy, for example, can cause problems with the digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, and other digestive issues. It can also affect the heart, causing symptoms such as irregular heartbeats, heart palpitations, and chest pain.\n\nDiabetic neuropathies are often associated with high blood sugar levels, but they can also develop in individuals with well-controlled diabetes. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial to managing diabetic neuropathies and minimizing their impact on overall health."}

Chronic pain persists. Pain signals keep firing in the nervous system for weeks, months, even years. There may have been an initial mishap -- sprained back, serious infection, or there may be an ongoing cause of pain -- arthritis, cancer, ear infection, but some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage. Many chronic pain conditions affect older adults. Common chronic pain complaints include headache, low back pain, cancer pain, arthritis pain, neurogenic pain (pain resulting from damage to the peripheral nerves or to the central nervous system itself), psychogenic pain (pain not due to past disease or injury or any visible sign of damage inside or outside the nervous system). A person may have two or more co-existing chronic pain conditions. Such conditions can include chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial cystitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and vulvodynia. It is not known whether these disorders share a common cause.", "predict": "Chronic pain is a persistent condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a persistent pain that lasts for more than three months, despite various treatments. Chronic pain can be triggered by various factors such as injury, infection, or medical conditions. It can also be the result of pain that has persisted for a long time, such as that caused by cancer or other diseases. Some common types of chronic pain include back pain, neck pain, headaches, and pain related to arthritis.\n\nOne of the most common causes of chronic pain is musculoskeletal disorders, which include conditions like back pain, neck pain, and joint pain. These conditions can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as overuse, injury, or underlying health problems. Other causes of chronic pain include nerve damage, pain related to cancer, and pain associated with chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nChronic pain can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, affecting their ability to perform daily activities and enjoy hobbies. It can lead to depression, anxiety, and a decreased sense of well-being. In severe cases, chronic pain can also contribute to substance abuse and other behavioral health issues.\n\nIt is important to note that chronic pain is not the same as acute pain, which is a temporary response to injury or illness. Acute pain typically resolves within a few weeks or months, while chronic pain can persist for months or even years. Chronic pain can be challenging to manage, and individuals with chronic pain often require ongoing treatment and support to manage their symptoms effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, chronic pain is a complex condition that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life.
